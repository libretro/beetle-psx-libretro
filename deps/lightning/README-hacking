This README-hacking file describes the development environment.

Everything related to the development of GNU lightning is on Savannah:
https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/lightning/.


* Working from the Repository

** Autotools

This distribution uses the latest stable versions of Automake, Autoconf.  If
you are getting the sources from git (or change configure.ac), you'll need
to have these tools installed to (re)build.  All
of these programs are available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.

If you're using a GNU/Linux distribution, the easiest way to install these
packages depends on your system.  The following shell command should work
for Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake


** Building

If you intend to do development work with lightning, it's useful to build
lightning with its disassembler feature enabled.  This optional feature
requires additional dependencies.  On Ubuntu, this command should work:

    $ sudo apt-get install binutils-dev libiberty-dev zlib1g-dev

After getting the git sources, and installing the tools above, you can run

    $ ./bootstrap
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check

to do a fresh build.  At this point, there should be no difference between
your local copy, and the master copy:

    $ git diff

should output no difference.

After that first time, running make should suffice.

To install lightning:

    $ sudo make install

** Gnulib

This distribution also uses Gnulib (https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib) to
share common files, stored as a submodule in git.

** Updating

    $ git pull
    $ git submodule update

** Updating a submodule

To update a submodule, say gnulib, do as follows:

Get the most recent version of the master branch from git.

    $ cd gnulib
    $ git pull

Make sure GNU lightning can live with that version of gnulib.

    $ cd ..
    $ ./bootstrap
    $ make distcheck

Register your changes.

    $ git commit ...
