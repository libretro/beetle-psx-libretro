# First and foremost consider this:
- This is a DEVELOPER oriented channel dedicated to report bugs and suggest features about the libretro core, please do not ask for help;
- The upstream bug tracker is a forum thread, located at https://forum.fobby.net/index.php?t=msg&th=1114;
    - Note: As of October 2018, Microsoft email providers (think email addresses ending with hotmail/live/outlook) are rejecting email from the forum. If you want to register an account in the upstream project's forum, consider using another mail provider.
- For game-related bugs:
    1) First, check if it's already reported on the upstream bug tracker;
    2) If it's not reported there, try to reproduce the bug with mednafen;
    3) If it's reproducible with mednafen, report it on the upstream bugtracker;
    4) If it's not reproducible with mednafen, ONLY THEN should you report it here.
